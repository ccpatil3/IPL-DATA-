IPL DATA VISUALIZATION
BCCI wants to understand the performance of cricket of every team. Design the dashboard
which clearly explains about cricket match, performance of players, outcome of match and every
single factor which is responsible for the match like venue, toss, captain’s performance,
individual’s performance etc over the years.
Dashboard should be able to explain and give answers to following questions raised by
BCCI.
1. Does age matter in the performance of a game?
2. How many matches have been held from 2008 to 2017?
3. How many matches have been held in different venues? Which venue has hosted the highest
and least number of matches?
4. Which team has won the most number of matches?
5. Which team has won the most number of tosses?
6. What percent of types of batting are involved by players?
7. What are the different types of bowling adapted by bowlers?
8. What are the different countries from where players have come?
